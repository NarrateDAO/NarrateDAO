## 💡 About NarrateDAO

**NarrateDAO** is a project to make tools more human —
turning complex workflows into **modular AI agents** that adapt, learn, and work alongside us.

We’re building:

* 🧠 Agent-native infrastructure
* 🔁 Composable, remixable automations
* 🧩 Human-in-the-loop orchestration
* 📦 Open, forkable workflows

---

## 🎯 Our Goal

To make software feel more like a conversation than a configuration.
To empower anyone — not just developers — to build with agents, by telling the system what they want.

## 🤝 Why Sponsor?

Your support helps us:

* Build open infrastructure for agent-native apps
* Stay independent and focused on the community
* Make automation more accessible, personal, and creative

> We don’t just want to automate work — we want to **reinvent how we build**.
